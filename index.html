<h1>Hiking Is My Hobby!</h1>
<p>My name is Dalveer and I am a 19 year old Community College Student and my favorite personal hobby is hiking. I enjoy hiking because of the interaction with my family and friends. Group hikes are enjoyable and it's fun to talk to people by my age. It's one of the least talked about hobbies and I think it's fun for people who are into exploration and adventure. Getting to walk into trails and see the outdoor views is remarkable for any age. </p>

    <p>I think hiking is not talked about as a hobby. Hiking is basically nature's therapy and it's very enjoyable. Also, it's quite therapeutic. Bringing out friends and seeing the spectacular view is one of the most memorable moments in life. Most hiking popular attracts have amazing waterfalls, rivers, valleys, and caves. Personally, I usually go hiking with my family and friends during special events like vacation or traveling.</p>
